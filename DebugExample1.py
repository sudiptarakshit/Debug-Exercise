# Break Point, Show Execution Point, and Step Over

# Breakpoints are special markers that suspend program execution at a specific point.
# This lets you examine the program state and behavior.
# Breakpoints can be simple (for example, suspending the program on reaching some line of code)
# or involve more complex logic (checking against additional conditions, writing log messages, and so on).
